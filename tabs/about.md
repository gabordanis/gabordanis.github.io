Hello, I'm Gábor. I created this blog so that I can share my thoughts and tips in software development. 

Currently working in the Java / Spring realm for backend with Angular and Flutter for frontend. Somewhat fancying Microsoft / .NET technologies as well, but struggling to find the time for them :(
