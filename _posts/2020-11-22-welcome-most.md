In this cold day in November I finally started my professional blog / site. I don't know how frequent I will be able to post or how interesting they will be. I'm not even sure about this theme: it looks and works really nicely, but uses *scary* bash scripts (so I'm not sure about its future-proofness - and honestly I can't make a lot out of it..).

So what am I gonna write about? Tips, methods, rants, experiences, complaints, anything. My future dream is to start an actual magazine with multiple co-authors with who we would write short tutorials and tips. Until that is realized, however, I will have this site to practice writing (it really does have room for improvement..) :)
